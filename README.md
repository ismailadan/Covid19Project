# COVID19 Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, I explore a big dataset downloaded from ourworldindata to analyse Covid deaths and Vaccinations acrros different dimensions.
I utilised MS SQL Server to explore the data and create views for later visualisation.

# Tableau 

Having explored the data, I connected my SQL views to Tableau to visualise the data and created an interactive dashboard, uploaded to Tableau Public
